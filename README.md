[ Features ]
  - You have to press space when doing a exercise to get more percentage until u finish your exercise, it also includes a /motion command
  where you can walk, jog or run but running gives more percentage than jogging that gives more than walking (You can stop the motion
  session by executing the command again). You can only start a motion session 2 times per restart as it is stored in the client side.
